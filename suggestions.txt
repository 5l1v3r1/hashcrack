
The program tries to pick some sensible defaults, but if it's not getting anything for you, try the following:

Try phrases, dictionary words and previously found words. The latter will get them fromm your pot file - useful for trying found passwords against different hash types:

--phrases --words --found

Try existing dictionaries with common suffixes: 

-d dict\Top95Thousand-probable.txt -e dict\last3.txt
-d dict\Top95Thousand-probable.txt -e dict\last4.txt

If you spot patterns, try and use them, e.g. digits followed by something more complex:

-d dict\last3.txt --lmask ?d?d?d?d?d?d



or something complex followed by digits:

-d dict\Top95Thousand-probable.txt --rmask ?d?d?d?d?d?d


or use a crib file of found passwords or guesses - keep it short though. This will generate variants of crib in one pass (leet2 rules) and then use the resulting file to attack using more rules.

# cat crib.txt
foobar
baz
quux

$ python3 hashcrack.py -i ../128hex.txt --crib dict/crib.txt
